            <h2>History of JobSphere</h2>
            <p>
              JobSphere began in the heart of Los Santos as a small start-up,
              founded by tech-savvy individuals who saw the challenges the
              city's job market presented. With the rapid expansion of
              industries in Los Santos—from Vinewood's entertainment sector to
              the corporate hubs downtown—the creators noticed that many
              talented individuals struggled to find suitable jobs. This
              realization inspired them to create a platform that would simplify
              the job search process, making it more accessible to everyone in
              the city.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Launched in 2018, JobSphere started as a modest job board, mainly
              listing opportunities in the growing tech and media industries.
              However, as word spread about its effectiveness and ease of use,
              the platform expanded to include job listings across various
              sectors, from the docks of Elysian Island to the luxury boutiques
              of Rockford Hills. What began as a small endeavor quickly gained
              momentum, thanks to its user-friendly interface and commitment to
              matching the right candidates with the right employers.
