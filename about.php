          <h2>History of JobSphere</h2>
          <p>
            JobSphere began in the heart of Los Santos as a small start-up,
            founded by tech-savvy individuals who saw the challenges the
            city's job market presented. With the rapid expansion of
            industries in Los Santos—from Vinewood's entertainment sector to
            the corporate hubs downtown—the creators noticed that many
            talented individuals struggled to find suitable jobs. This
            realization inspired them to create a platform that would simplify
            the job search process, making it more accessible to everyone in
            the city.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Launched in 2018, JobSphere started as a modest job board, mainly
            listing opportunities in the growing tech and media industries.
            However, as word spread about its effectiveness and ease of use,
            the platform expanded to include job listings across various
            sectors, from the docks of Elysian Island to the luxury boutiques
            of Rockford Hills. What began as a small endeavor quickly gained
            momentum, thanks to its user-friendly interface and commitment to
            matching the right candidates with the right employers.
